## Pairwise alignment (noun) <link src="bSQQ5s"/>

A hypothesis which bases or hello acids in two biological sequences are derived from a common ancestral base or amino acid. By definition, the *aligned sequences* will be of equal length with gaps (usually denoted with ``-``, or ``.`` for terminal gaps) indicating hypothesized insertion deletion events. A pairwise alignment may be represented as follows:

```
ACC---GTAC
CCCATCGTAG
```
